## Relationships Between Sets
## Chapter 0.3

### Equal Relations:
#### When 2 sets are set to be equal, this means that both sets have the same elements. This also means that the order of the elements does not matter.
#### Example:
{4, 6, 8} = {8, 4, 6}

### Subset Relations:
#### When 2 sets do not equal each other, but contain the same values or elements as the other, this creates a Subset.
#### Example:
Considering the set 1 = {2, 4, 6, 8} is not equal to 2 = {2, 4, 6}, the 2nd set still is a subset to the first set, as we see that all of the values in the second set are within the first set. This does not mean that the first set is a subset of the second set as not all of the values of the first set are contained within the second.

## From this, we see how B contains the same number's as A, this means that A is a Subset of B

### Power set:
#### A power set relatess to all of the subsets of the forementioned set. This inclues all subsets of the set, the empty set, and the original set itself.
#### Example:
 Consider the set A = {1, 2}, the power set to this set would be P(A) = {{}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}, as you can see the power set contains the empty set, all subsets of the set, and the orignial set itself.

## From this, we see how all of the values within {1, 2, 9} are distributed into its proper subsets to create the power set.

### Cardinality:
#### Another way to compare sets with each other is to consider the size of the set. This is measured by the number of elements within a set.
#### Example:
The proper way to write the cardinality of set's A and B would be |A| = 4 |B| = 2. Measuring the Cardinality is as simple as just counting the elements. Such as {2, 4, 6, 2, 4} would be 3, this is since elements that are repeated should not be considered.
